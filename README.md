#  Fleet & Vehicle Utilisation Dashboard

##  Overview

This project simulates a Power BI dashboard for monitoring operational performance of a mid-sized vehicle fleet. Built using synthetic data modeled on Dynamics 365, the dashboard helps decision-makers understand utilisation trends, cost efficiency, fuel performance, and maintenance breakdowns.

This is designed to showcase my capabilities in business analysis, data modeling, dashboard design, and stakeholder-aligned reporting — particularly for operations and finance roles in digitally transforming environments.
